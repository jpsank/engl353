[Intro: Daz Dillinger]
(Ahh) Hahaha, I'm serious, nigga
One of y'all niggas got some bad motherfuckin' breath (Oh, man)
Ayy, baby, ayy, baby (Shit)
Ayy, baby, gimme some bubblegum in this motherfucker or somethin', haha
Ride with me to get somethin' to eat, dog, ayy, nigga
Study long, study wrong, nigga

[Verse 1: Snoop Dogg]
With so much drama in the L-B-C
It's kind of hard bein' Snoop D-O-double-G

But I, somehow, some way
Keep comin' up with funky-ass shit, like, every single day

May I kick a little something (Yeah)
For the Gs and make a few ends (Yeah)
As I breeze through? Two in the mornin'
And the party's still jumpin' 'cause my mama ain't home
I got bitches in the livin' room gettin' it on, and
They ain't leavin' 'til six in the mornin'
 (Six in the mornin', six in the mornin')
So what you wanna do? Shit
I got a pocket full of rubbers and my homeboys do too

So turn off the lights and close the doors
But (But what?) we don't love them hoes (Yeah)

So we gon' smoke an ounce to this
Gs up, hoes down
 while you motherfuckers bounce to this

[Chorus: Daz Dillinger & Lil David Ruffin, Snoop Dogg & Daz Dillinger]
Rollin' down the street, smokin' indo
Sippin' on gin and juice

Laid back
With my mind on my money and my money on my mind

Rollin' down the street, smokin' indo
Sippin' on gin and juice

Laid back
With my mind on my money and my money on my mind


[Verse 2: Snoop Dogg]
Now that I got me some Seagram's gin

Everybody got they cups, but they ain't chipped in
Now this type of shit happens all the time
You gotta get yours, but fool, I gotta get mine

Everything is fine when you listening to the D-O-G
I got the cultivating music that be captivating he
Who listens to the words that I speak
As I take me a drank to the middle of the street
And get to mackin' to this bitch named Sadie (Sadie?)
She used to be the homeboy's lady (Oh, that bitch?)

Eighty degrees when I tell that bitch, "Please
Raise up off these N-U-Ts, 'cause you gets none of these"

At ease, as I mob with the Dogg Pound
Feel the breeze biatch, I'm just

[Chorus: Snoop Dogg & Daz Dillinger]
Rollin' down the street, smokin' indo
Sippin' on gin and juice

Laid back
With my mind on my money and my money on my mind

Rollin' down the street, smokin' indo
Sippin' on gin and juice

Laid back
With my mind on my money and my money on my mind


[Verse 3: Snoop Dogg]
Later on that day, my homie Dr. Dre
Came through with a gang of Tanqueray

And a fat ass J of some bubonic chronic
That made me choke
, shit, this ain't no joke
I had to back up off of it and sit my cup down

Tanqueray and chronic, yeah, I'm fucked up now
But it ain't no stoppin', I'm still poppin'
Dre got some bitches from the city of Compton
To serve me, not with a cherry on top
'Cause when I bust my nut, I'm raising up out the cot
Don't get upset, girl, that's just how it goes
I don't love you hoes, I'm out the door, and I'll be


[Chorus: Snoop Dogg & Daz Dillinger]
Rollin' down the street, smokin' indo
Sippin' on gin and juice

Laid back
With my mind on my money and my money on my mind

Rollin' down the street, smokin' indo
Sippin' on gin and juice

Laid back
With my mind on my money and my money on my mind

Rollin' down the street, smokin' indo
Sippin' on gin and juice
Biatch

With my mind on my money and my money on my mind

Rollin' down the street, smokin' indo
Sippin' on gin and juice
Biatch

With my mind on my money and my money on my mind

[Chorus: Snoop Dogg]
When the pimp's in the crib, ma
(Drop it like it's hot, drop it like it's hot, drop it like it's hot)

When the pigs try to get at you
(Park it like it's hot, park it like it's hot, park it like it's hot)

And if a nigga get a attitude
(Pop it like it's hot, pop it like it's hot, pop it like it's hot)

I got the Rollie on my arm and I'm pourin' Chandon

And I roll the best weed
, 'cause I got it goin' on

[Verse 1: Pharrell Williams]
I'm a nice dude (Uh), with some nice dreams
 (Yep)
See these ice cubes?
 (Uh) See these Ice Creams?

Eligible bachelor, million dollar boat
That's whiter than what's spillin' down your throat

The Phantom, exterior like fish eggs

The interior like suicide-wrist red

I can exercise you, this can be your Phys. Ed
Cheat on your man,
 ma, that's how you get ahizzead

Killer with the beat,
 I know killers in the street

With the steel that'll make you feel like Chinchilla in the heat

So don't try to run up on my ear talkin' all that raspy shit, tryna ask me shit

When my niggas fill your vest, they ain't gon' pass me shit

You should think about it, take a second
Matter-fact, you should take four, B

And think before you fuck with-a lil' Skateboard P


[Chorus: Snoop Dogg]
When the pimp's in the crib, ma
(Drop it like it's hot, drop it like it's hot, drop it like it's hot)

[Verse 2: Snoop Dogg]
I'm a gangsta, but y'all knew that
Da Big Boss Dogg, yeah, I had to do that
I keep a blue flag hangin' out my backside
But only on the left side, yeah, that's the Crip side

Ain't no other way to play the game the way I play
I cut so much, you thought I was a DJ *vinyl rewind*
(Two, re-pe-re-pe, one, yep, three)

S-N double O-P, D-O double G
I can't fake it, just break it, and when I take it
See, I specialize in makin' all the girls get naked
So bring your friends, all of y'all come inside
We got a world premiere right here, now get live (So don't)
So don't change the dizzle
, turn it up a little
I got a livin' room full of fine dime brizzles

Waitin' on the Pizzle, the Dizzle and the Chizzle
G's to the bizzack, now, ladies, here we gizzo

[Chorus: Snoop Dogg]
When the pimp's in the crib, ma

[Verse 3: Snoop Dogg]

I'm a bad boy with a lotta hoes

Drive my own cars and wear my own clothes

I hang out tough, I'm a real boss
Big Snoop Dogg, yeah, he's so sharp
On the TV screen and in the magazines
If you play me close, you're on a red beam

Oh, you got a gun, so you wanna pop back?
AK-47 now, nigga, stop that
Cement shoes, now I'm on the move

Your family's cryin', now you on the news
They can't find you and now they miss you
Must I remind you, I'm only here to twist you
Pistol-whip you, dip you, then flip you
Then dance to this mothafuckin' music we Crip to
Subscribe, nigga, get your issue

Baby, come close, let me see how you get loose

[Chorus: Snoop Dogg]
When the pimp's in the crib, ma
(Drop it like it's hot, drop it like it's hot, drop it like it's hot)

When the pigs try to get at you
(Park it like it's hot, park it like it's hot, park it like it's hot)
And if a nigga get a attitude
(Pop it like it's hot, pop it like it's hot, pop it like it's hot)

From the depths of the sea, back to the block
Snoop Doggy Dogg, funky as the, the, The D.O.C.
Â 
Went solo on that ass, but it's still the same

Long Beach is the spot where I serve my 'caine

Follow me, follow me, follow me, follow me, but don't lose your grip
Nine-trizzay's the yizzear for me to fuck up shit

So I ain't holdin nothin' back
And motherfucker, I got five on a twenty sack

'Cause I never hesitate to put a nigga on his back

And niggas can't fuck with that
Shit that I drop 'cause ya know it don't stop
Mr. One Eight Seven on a motherfuckin' cop

Tick-tock, never the Glock, just some nuts and a cock

Robbin' motherfuckers, then I kill dem bloodclots

Then I step through the fog and I creep through the smog

'Cause I'm Snoop Doggy (Who?) Doggy (What?) Doggy Dogg

And wave the motherfuckers like ya just don't care

Yeah, roll up the dank and pour the drank
And watch your stank (Why?) 'cause Doggy's on the gank

My bank roll's on swoll

My shit's on hit, legit, now I'm on parole, stroll

With Tha Dogg Pound right behind me
And up in your bitch is where ya might find me
Layin' that, playin' that G Thang

[Verse 1: Snoop Dogg & Dr. Dre]

One, two, three and to the four
Snoop Doggy Dogg and Dr. Dre is at the door

Ready to make an entrance so back on up
'Cause you know we're 'bout to rip shit up

Give me the microphone first, so I can bust like a bubble

Compton and Long Beach together, now you know you in trouble

Ain't nothin' but a "G" thang, baby

Two loced out niggas goin' crazy

Death Row is the label that pays me

Unfadeable so please don't try to fade this (Hell yeah)

But, um, back to the lecture at hand
Perfection is perfected, so I'ma let 'em understand
From a young G's perspective

And before me dig out a bitch, I have to find a contraceptive

You never know, she could be earnin' her man and learnin' her man
And at the same time burnin' her man

Now, you know I ain't with that shit, Lieutenant
Ain't no pussy good enough to get burnt while I'm up in it (Yeah)

And that's realer than Real-Deal Holyfield

And now you hookers and hoes know how I feel
Well, if it's good enough to get broke off a proper chunk
I'll take a small piece of some of that funky stuff

[Chorus: Dr. Dre & Snoop Dogg, Snoop Dogg]
It's like this and like that and like this and aâ
It's like that and like this and like that and aâ
It's like this and like that and like this and aâ
Dre
, creep to the mic like a phantom

[Verse 2: Dr. Dre]
Well, I'm peepin' and I'm creepin' and I'm creepin'
But I damn near got caught 'cause my beeper kept beepin'

Now it's time for me to make my impression felt
So sit back, relax, and strap on your seat belt
You never been on a ride like this before
With a producer who can rap and control the micstro
At the same time with the dope rhyme that I kick

You know and I know, I flow some old funky shit
To add to my collection, the selection
Symbolizes dope, take a toke, but don't choke
If you do, you'll have no clue
Of what me and my homie Snoop Dogg came to do

[Chorus: Both, Dr. Dre & Snoop Dogg]
It's like this and like that and like this and aâ
It's like that and like this and like that and aâ
It's like this, and who gives a fuck about those?
So just chill 'til the next episode


[Refrain: Kid Dynamite, Public Enemy & Congress Alley]

You've got the feeling

Rock the other side
You've got the feeling (Yeah, yeah)

[Verse 3: Snoop Dogg, Dr. Dre & Both]
Fallin' back on that ass with a hellafied gangster lean

Gettin' funky on the mic like a old batch of collard greens

It's the capital S, oh, yes, I'm fresh, N-double-O-P
D-O-double-G-Y, D-O-double-G, you see

Showin' much flex when it's time to wreck a mic

Pimpin' hoes and clockin' a grip like my name was Dolemite

Yeah, and it don't quit
I think they in the mood for some motherfuckin' G shit (Hell yeah)
So, Dre (What up, Dogg?)
Gotta give 'em what they want (What's that, G?)
We gotta break 'em off somethin' (Hell yeah)
And it's gotta be bumpin' (City of Compton
)

[Verse 4: Dr. Dre]
Is where it takes place, so when asked, your attention
Mobbin' like a motherfucker but I ain't lynchin'

Droppin' the funky shit that's makin' the sucker niggas mumble
When I'm on the mic, it's like a cookie, they all crumble
Try to get close and your ass'll get smacked

My motherfuckin' homie Doggy Dogg has got my back
Never let me slip, 'cause if I slip, then I'm slippin'

But if I got my nina, then you know I'm straight trippin'

And I'ma continue to put the rap down, put the mack down
And if you bitches talk shit, I have to put the smack down

Yeah, and you don't stop
I told you I'm just like a clock when I tick and I tock
But I'm never off, always on to the break of dawn
C-O-M-P-T-O-N and the city they call Long Beach
Puttin' the shit together

Like my nigga D.O.C., no one can do it better


[Chorus: Both & Dr. Dre & Snoop Dogg]
Like this, that and this and aâ
It's like that and like this and like that and aâ
It's like this, and who gives a fuck about those?
So just chill 'til the next episode


[Outro: Kid Dynamite, Public Enemy & Congress Alley]
You've got the feeling
Rock the other side
You've got the feeling (Yeah, yeah)
You've got the feeling
Rock the other side
You've got the feeling (Yeah, yeah)
You've got the feeling
Rock the other side
You've got the feeling (Yeah, yeah)
