[Interlude: Puff Daddy]
Every day I wake up, I hope I'm dreamin'
I can't believe this shit
Can't believe you ain't here
Sometimes it's just hard for a nigga to wake up

It's just hard to just keep goin'
It's like I feel empty inside without you bein' here
I would do anything, man, to bring you back
I'd give all this shit up, this shit don't mean nothing
I saw your son today, he look just like you
You was the greatest, you'll always be the greatest
I miss you, B.I.G.Â 
Can't wait 'til that day when I see your face again
I can't wait 'til that day when I see your face again

[Intro: Puff Daddy]
Yeah, this right here (Tell me why)
Goes out to everyone that has lost someone
That they truly loved (C'mon, check it out)

[Verse 1: Puff Daddy]
It seems like yesterday we used to rock the show
I laced the track, you locked the flow
So far from hangin' on the block for dough
Notorious, they got to know that

Life ain't always what it seem to be
Words can't express what you mean to me
Even though you're gone, we still a team
Through your family, I'll fulfill your dream (That's right)

In the future, can't wait to see
If you open up the gates for me

Reminisce some time, the night they took my friend
Try to black it out, but it plays again

When it's real, feelings hard to conceal
Can't imagine all the pain I feel

Give anythin' to hear half your breath (Half your breath)
I know you still livin' your life after death

[Chorus: Faith Evans & Puff Daddy]
Every step I take
Every move I make
Every single day, every time I pray
I'll be missin' you
Thinkin' of the day
When you went away
What a life to take, what a bond to break
I'll be missin' you
 (I miss you, B.I.G.)

[Verse 2: Puff Daddy]
It's kinda hard with you not around (Yeah)
Know you in Heaven, smilin' down (Ha)
Watchin' us while we pray for you
Every day we pray for you
'Til the day we meet again
In my heart is where I'll keep you, friend
Memories give me the strength I need to proceed
Strength I need to believe
My thoughts, B.I.G., I just can't define (Can't define)
Wish I could turn back the hands of time
Us in the six, shop for new clothes and kicks
You and me takin' flicks
Makin' hits
, stages they receive you on
Still can't believe you're gone (Can't believe you're gone)
Give anything to hear half your breath (Half your breath)
I know you still livin' your life after death

[Chorus: Faith Evans]
Every step I take
Every move I make (I miss you)
Every single day, every time I pray
I'll be missin' you (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
Thinkin' of the day
When you went away
What a life to take, what a bond to break
I'll be missin' you
 (Somebody tell me why)

[Interlude: Faith Evans]

One glad morning
When this life is over
I know I'll see your face


[Outro: 112, Puff Daddy & Faith Evans
]
Every night I pray, every step I take
Every move I make, every single day
Every night I pray, every step I take (Every day that passes is a day that I get closer)
Every move I make, every single day (To seeing you again)
Every night I pray, every step I take (We miss you, B.I.G., and we won't stop 'cause we can't stop
)
Every move I make, every single day (That's right)
Every night I pray, every step I take
Every move I make, every single day (We miss you, B.I.G)
Every step I take
[Intro: Ginwuine, Diddy, Ginuwine & Mario Winans]
Ooh, ooh, ooh
Yeah, its that bounce right here
Come on
Time to move on, time to be strong
Don't stop now, straight to the top now
Someone who truly understands
How to treat a man
This is what I need

[Verse 1: Diddy & Ginuwine]
Girl, you made me believe again
If you happy, then be with him
Go 'head, mami, breathe again, go 'head, mami, breathe again
Don't stop now straight to the top now
Go 'head, mami, make it hot now
I need me a love that's gon' make my heart stop now
And what I need is simple, five foot five with dimples
Potential wife credentials
Know about the life I'm into, life I been through
And how I had a triflin' mental
So ride with me, G Force, fly with me
Times get hard, cry with me, die with me
White beach sands, lie with me
My advice is forget the limelight
Let's make love, while we listen to Frank White
(This is what I need) So tight, now I understand life

[Chorus: Ginuwine & Mario Winans, Ginuwine, & P. Diddy]
What I need (Yeah, take that), oh, baby
Is a pretty woman next to me (A pretty woman, yeah, baby)
To share the dreams that I believe (Dream with me, believe in me) (Come on)
Maybe we could start a family (Start a family, baby)
Someone who truly understands (Oh, yeah) how to treat a man
(How to treat a man, baby) This is what I need

[Verse 2: Loon, Loon & Ginuwine & Diddy]
Listen to me now, what should I say now? Come on, ma
Been a whole day, now I wanna lay 'round
And sip coladas, dipped in Prada
I'm smooth as Erik Estrada
, dipped in dollars
We out in Vegas Nevada, bubble bath in the champagne glass
'Bout the size of a campaign ad
You don't know how you look to me
But if love was a crime, you'd be a crook to me
'Cause mami, I done been around the world
Seen a lot of places
Been around your girl, believe I read faces
I can tell she don't want me to prevail
But I learn my lesson watchin' Sean stressin'
So why listen to her and start guessin'?
Mami, you ain't ready to ride then start dressin'
I need a girl to receive my mom's blessin'
Confession, my love no contestin'
I need affection
Yes, I need affection, let's go Mario, talk to e'm

[Bridge: Mario Winans, Mario & Ginuwine]
Girl, what the hell is on your mind?
I could be dumb but I'm not blind
There's something leakin' in your mind
Don't look too good for you and me
Always getting weak
That ain't what I need, baby

[Chorus: Mario Winans Mario Winans & Ginuwine]
Is a pretty woman next to me (Oh, please, baby)
To share the dreams that I believe (I need a girl in my life)
Maybe we could start a family (Start a family, baby)
Someone who truly understands
How to treat a man (How to treat a man)
This is what I need

[Verse 3: Diddy]
Ayo, the sun don't shine forever
But as long as we're here, then we might as well shine together

Never mind the weather, go somewhere and get our minds together
Build a love that'll last forever
So let's stop the pain, stop the rain
Put stress to rest girl, stop the games
Name the spot, mami, I got the plane
Roll through rough, I got the Range
Ma, I got some thangs, known to put rocks in rings
Pushing hundred-foot yachts and thangs
Your man don't play, have you ever been to Saint-Tropez
Or seen a brotha play a Mandolay?
Girl, I wanna just look in your eyes and watch the sunrise
No more lies, no more tears to cry
No more reasons for leavin', you, I believe in
Love you 'til the day I stop breathing
I love you, girl

[Outro: Ginuwine & Mario Winans, Ginuwine, Mario Winans, Tammy Ruggeri]
This is what I need (Yes, I do)
Is a pretty woman next to me
Standing next to me, girl
To share the dreams that I believe
When I wake up in the morning
Maybe we could start a family
I wanna see your pretty face
Someone who truly understands how to treat a man
Oh, yeah, oh, yeah
This is what I need (Is that all you want?)
Is a pretty woman next to me (Make the sacrifice)
To share the dreams that I believe (And maybe, maybe we)
Someone who truly understands how to treat a man
This is what I need baby
Is a pretty woman next to me
Standing next to me, girl
To share the dreams that I believe
When I wake up in the morning
Maybe we could start a family
I wanna see your pretty face, baby
Someone who truly understands, how to treat a man
Oh yeah, oh yeah
This is what I need
Is a pretty woman next to me
[Chorus: Diddy]
Last night, I couldn't even get an answer
I tried to call, but my pride wouldn't let me dial
And I'm sitting here, with this blank expression
And the way I feel, I wanna curl up like a child


[Post-Chorus: Diddy]
I know you can hear me
I know you can feel me
I can't live without you
God, please make me better
I wish I wasn't the way I am

[Verse: Keyshia Cole]
If I told you once, I told you twice
You can see it in my eyes
I'm all cried out, with nothing to say
You're everything I wanted to be
If you could only see, it all belongs to me
I love you so much, I'm yearning for your touch
Come and set me free, forever yours, I'll be
Baby, won't you come and take this pain away?

[Chorus: Diddy & Keyshia Cole]
Last night, I couldn't even get an answer
(You said you couldn't get an answer, baby)
I tried to call, but my pride wouldn't let me dial
(That should never stop you)
And I'm sitting here (Sitting there) with this blank expression
(I can't read your mind, baby)
And the way I feel (The way I feel), I wanna curl up like a child

(Ooh baby)

[Refrain: Keyshia Cole]
I need you and you need me
This is so plain to see
And I would never let you go
And I will always love you so, I will
If you could only see, your heart belongs to me
(If you could only see, your heart belongs to me)
I love you so much, I'm yearning for your touch
Come and set me free, forever yours, I'll be
(Come and set me free)
Baby, won't you come and take this pain away

[Chorus: Diddy & (Keyshia Cole)]
Last night (Oh, last night), I couldn't even get an answer
(Oh baby, what you wanna do to me?)
I tried to call (Alright), but my pride wouldn't let me dial
(Why would you just hurt me, baby? Oh)
And I'm sitting here, with this blank expression
(Don't save me, baby, don't, no)
And the way I feel, I wanna curl up like a child

(I'm so alone, I'm so lonely, baby, oh)

[Break: Diddy & Keyshia Cole]
Tell me what words to say to make you come back
Don't break me like that (Ooh)
And if it matters, I'd rather stay home (Baby)
With you, I'm never alone
Don't wanna wait 'til you're gone (Ooh)
Whatever you do, just don't leave me

[Chorus: Diddy & (Keyshia Cole)]
Last night (Yeah), I couldn't even get an answer (Didn't get an answer, baby)
(Oh) I tried to call (Call me, baby), but my pride wouldn't let me dial
(Oh, couldn't you just dial me, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby?
)
And I'm sitting here with this blank expression (Don't sit there, no)
And the way I feel (Alright, yeah), I wanna curl up like a child

(I'm so alone, I'm so lonely, baby, oh)

[Refrain: Keyshia Cole]
I need you and you need me (I need you)
This is so plain to see
And I would never let you go
And I will always love you so, I will
If you could only see (If you could only see), your heart belongs to me (Belongs to me)
I love you so much (So, so), I'm yearning for your touch
Come and set me free, forever yours, I'll be (Come and set me free)
Baby, won't you come and take my pain away?

[Chorus: Diddy & (Keyshia Cole)]
Last night, I couldn't even get an answer (I couldn't get you, baby, yeah, oh)
I tried to call (Call me, baby), but my pride wouldn't let me dial
(Why couldn't you just dial me, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby?)
And I'm sitting here, with this blank expression (Don't sit there, no)
And the way I feel (Alright, yeah), I wanna curl up like a child

(I'm so alone, I'm so lonely, baby)

[Bridge: Keyshia Cole]
Why don't you pick up the phone and dial up my number?
And call me up, baby, I'm waiting on you
Why don't you pick up the phone and dial up my number?
Just call me up, baby, I'm waiting on you

[Spoken Outro: Diddy]
[Phone dialing and ringing]
"Hello
Hey, what's up?
I've been tryin' to reach you all night
That shit ain't funny not picking up the motherfucking phone
Better stop fucking playing with a nigga's feelings like that
You know how much I love you, right?
But for them couple of seconds though
When I couldn't get in touch with you
I'm ready to come over your house and shoot that motherfucker up
You fucking dumb bitch
You better fucking not be there when I get over that house
Hahaha
That's really how it goes down, right?"
